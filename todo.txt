TO DO: 

1.  I need to make sure that in api.quality.ocr_quality that preprocess_image()  function 
    is not processing the image from the calling it from the disk, if yes then i should 
    make sure if its possibale to precess the image coming from the memory since in the previouse 
    stage yolo already prcess it in the memory and we must have the access to the image in the memor.

2.  I also need to make sure im not saving the preprocessed img to the disk in case i dont need it 
    in the production!!

3.  the same thing we have done in point number 1, we must check it for calculate_ocr_quality and sync_calculate_ocr_quality


4.  I need to think about the global scoring logic, maybe we can change the value of the alfa beta and gamma. 

5.  I need to think how to use the api.templates.error_template.json

6.  I need to make sure i freez the dependencies to the req file
